/*
The running time is 0.164 ms, it is much faster than without index.
The main reason is that after index, the total_price are sorted and stored in some kind of data structure(default is btree).
So it is much quicker to find the total_price that are > 650

-- [Extra Credit] A new analytical request has been given to you from your boss: For each category, 
-- rank the products in that category in descending order of their list prices. 
-- Use SQL’s window-based aggregation (i.e., the OVER clause) to find the ranks. 
-- Print out the product IDs, product names, categories, list prices, and ranks.
-- Read the “Advanced Aggregation in SQL” handout on the course wiki for more information about window queries in SQL.
